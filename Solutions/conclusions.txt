Question:
In the light of your observed correlation  in your original sample, what can you conclude about your hypotheses?

Answer:

The 95% CI of the randomised distribution does not include our sample correlation coefficient (0.36). 
We can therefore reject the null hypothesis at the 5% cut-off. We conclude that there is a non-null
correlation between sepal width and sepal length in orchids.
