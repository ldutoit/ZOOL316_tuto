Questions: 

Are the residuals normally distributed?

Knowing that they come as clusters from 9 different beaches? 
What kind of models have you seen in the previous section that allows you to deal with several observations from the same beach?

Answers: 

The residuals are not normally distributed.

The observations are not independent, we could use nested models!
