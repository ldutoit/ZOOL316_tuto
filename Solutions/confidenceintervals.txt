Question:

Are the CI from the bootstrap distribution and the one from the linear model similar? Identical?

Answer:

The confidence intervals are not that different but they are clearly not the same. You might think, that was close enough. 
But how do you know that, because you just checked. Resampling allows you to draw correct confidence intervals. The one given by the model is under
severl assumptions.
