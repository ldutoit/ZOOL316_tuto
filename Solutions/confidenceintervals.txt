Question:

Are the CI from the bootstrap distribution and the one from the linear model similar? Identical?

Answer:

The confidence intervals are not that different but they are clearly not the same. You might think, that was close enough.  Resampling allows you to draw the correct confidence intervals without being constrained by the assumptions of the model.
